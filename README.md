# Servant-HTMX-Examples
An Exploration of using HTMX in conjunction with Type Safe Haskell Servant Routes (For research of future HaskTMX library)

To run a particular example run `nix develop` to enter the developer shell, then run `stack ghci <FileName>` then run the `startApp` function of the associated file

Your app should be running on `localhost:8000`

Right now development on HaskTMX is WIP, if you are someone how programs using Haskell Servant and HTMX feel free to reach out
